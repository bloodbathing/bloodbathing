pt info rq
1. sv means semi-verbal and nv means non-verbal, i have either of these in my name from time to time
2. i don't respect tt/td and will ignore it if you have it in your name
3. c+h is fine if you interact and talk to me first, i'm not willing to sit with complete strangers
4. active most of the time when i'm online, whisper me if you can't catch my attention anyways
    - i prefer crowns/compliments in whispers so i can easier see them
