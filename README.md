# ponytown info! <3
1. i'm not online often, playing pt 24/7 isn't exactly my favorite thing to do.
2. i'm usually active whenever i am playing, so feel free to interact with me.
    - if, for whatever reason, i am not responding, you could try whispering instead.
      - i appreciate crowns/compliments in whispers, i see them there easier!!!
3. i do not respect tt/td/dnt/whatever. if i see it in your name, i will treat you as if it doesn't exist. take a break from the internet, work on your mental health.
4. c+h isn't welcome for complete strangers, you could at the very least interact and talk to me first.
5. my internet is ass, so if i poof in the middle of a conversation, blame that.
6. message to eyestrain ponies: kill yourselves!
